#One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points 
#given to the products after sales. The solution to this problem means providing greater 
#customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, prominence of the product for the sellers and 
#a seamless shopping experience for the buyers. Another problem is the correct 
#ordering of the comments given to the products. 
#Since misleading comments will directly affect the sale of the product, 
#it will cause both financial loss and loss of customers. In the solution of these two basic problems,
#e-commerce site and sellers will increase their sales, 
#while customers will complete their purchasing journey without any problems.
